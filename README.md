# Ball Pivoting Algorithm (BPA)

This is an exemplary implementation of the ball pivoting algorithm for creating triangle meshes from point clouds.
The implementation is intentionally kept simple and is based on:

- *The Ball-Pivoting Algorithm for Surface Reconstruction* by Fausto Bernardini, Joshua Mittleman, Holly Rushmeier, Claudio Silva and Gabriel Taubin
